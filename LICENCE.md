# THE "DO WHATEVER YOU WANT" LICENSE

**WHEREAS** the author has better things to do than chase people around with lawyers, and

**WHEREAS** life is too short for complicated licensing schemes, and

**WHEREAS** the author believes in the ancient legal principle of "YOLO",

**NOW THEREFORE**, be it known that:

You can copy, modify, distribute, sell, fold into paper airplanes, or use this software for literally anything you want. The author doesn't care and probably won't even notice.

**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY**: This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. It might work, it might not. It might summon demons or make your computer sentient. The author assumes no responsibility for any consequences, apocalyptic or otherwise.

If this software breaks something, you get to keep both pieces.

*Licensed under the WTFPL v2.0 spirit with extra sass.*
